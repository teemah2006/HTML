        Kainji Dam excavations showed ironworking by the 2nd century BC.
        The transition from Neolithic times to the Iron Age was accomplished without intermediate bronze production.
        Some
        have suggested the technology moved west from the Nile Valley.
        But the Iron Age in the Niger River valley and the forest region appears to predate the introduction of
        metallurgy
        in the upper savanna by more than 800 years, as well as predating it in the Nile Valley.
        More recent research suggests that iron metallurgy was developed independently in sub-Saharan
        Africa. <sup>[25][26][27][28]</sup>

        The Nok civilization thrived between 1,500 BC and AD 200.
        It produced life-sized terracotta figures that are some of the earliest known sculptures in
        sub-Saharan Africa <sup>[29][30][31][32][33]</sup> and smelted iron by about 550 BC and possibly a few centuries
        earlier. <sup>[25][26][27]</sup> Evidence of iron smelting has also been excavated at sites in the Nsukka region of
        southeast Nigeria: dating to 2000 BC at the site of Lejja <sup>[34]</sup> and to 750 BC and at the site of Opi.

        The Kano Chronicle highlights an ancient history dating to around 999 AD of the Hausa Sahelian city-state of
        Kano,
        with other major Hausa cities (or Hausa Bakwai) of Daura, Hadeija, Kano, Katsina, Zazzau, Rano, and Gobir all
        having
        recorded histories dating back to the 10th century. With the spread of Islam from the 7th century AD,
        the area became known as Sudan or as Bilad Al Sudan (English: Land of the Blacks). Since the populations were
        partially affiliated with the Arab Muslim culture of North Africa, they began trans-Saharan trade and were
        referred
        to by the Arabic speakers as Al-Sudan (meaning "The Blacks") as they were considered an extended part of the
        Muslim
        world.
        There are early historical references by medieval Arab and Muslim historians and geographers which refer to the
        Kanem Bornu Empire as the region's major centre for Islamic civilization. <sup>[citation needed]</sup>
